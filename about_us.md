Edinburgh University Quiz Society was founded to promote quizzing across the University, organise
events for every skill level as well as regularly participate in quizzes in the city. All society activities are run
under [our constitution](https://github.com/uoequizsoc/uoequizsoc.github.io/raw/master/EUQS-Const.pdf).

We host regular [events](/events/) throughout the academic year: we host tournament style
buzzer quizzes weekly to test your quizzing metal and more laid back monthly pub quizzes
featuring fun rounds written by our own society members. As well as this we host [ScotBowl](/scotbowl/),
an annual quiz tournament that sees quizzers from all across the UK battle it out in tense
"University Challenge" style rounds.
