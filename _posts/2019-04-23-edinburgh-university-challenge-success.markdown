Congratulations to the Edinburgh University Challenge Team for taking home the trophy last night, we're proud to say that some of the winning team were QuizSoccers! The Monday night final was nail-biting with the lead changing hands a number of times throughout. St Edmund Hall - Oxford were strong competition, keeping the pressure on for the whole match, making the whole affair incredibly tense (I couldn't look as the final minutes ticked down)!

If you want to try out tournament quizzing come along to our "Buzzer Quiz" sessions.  Or if you fancy something a bit more mild; our pub quizzes will return after the summer break so keep an eye out. While we don't organise the University Challenge trails we will keep members updated on when the trails are.

You can catch up on the season of University Challenge on BBC IPlayer.
