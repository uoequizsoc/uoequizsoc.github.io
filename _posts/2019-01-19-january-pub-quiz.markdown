We kicked off this year with a great pub quiz hosted kindly again by The Voodoo Rooms.
The competition was tight between "Prince Philip" and "Hapax Legomenon" fighting for the
top spot throughout the night however it resulted in a tie after strong rounds from both.
The prize for the best team name went to "Ken Dodd’s Dad’s Dog’s Dead" for amazing use of alliteration.

There were some good rounds; the Film and TV round featured had quizzers guessing who said
"With great power, comes great responsibility; the General Knowledge round saw participants
 trying to count the number of iPhones that have been released and the picture round
 trying to locate the "Upside-Down Statue of King Wenceslas Riding a Dead Horse".

We hope to see you soon at the February Quiz on the 28th! In the meantime make sure
